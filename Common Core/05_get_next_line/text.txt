Razors pain you;
Rivers are damp;
Acids stain you;
And drugs cause cramp.
Guns aren’t lawful;
Nooses give;
Gas smells awful;
You might as well live.
"Résumé" by Dorothy Parker. 1926



Needle, needle, dip and dart,
    Thrusting up and down,
Where’s the man could ease a heart
Like a satin gown?

See the stitches curve and crawl
Round the cunning seams—
Patterns thin and sweet and small
As a lady’s dreams.

Wantons go in bright brocades;
Brides in organdie;
Gingham’s for the plighted maid;
Satin’s for the free!

Wool’s to line a miser’s chest;
Crape’s to calm the old;
Velvet hides an empty breast;
Satin’s for the bold!

Lawn is for a bishop’s yoke;
Linen’s for a nun;
Satin is for wiser folk—
Would the dress were done!

Satin glows in candle-light—
Satin’s for the proud!
They will say who watch at night,
“What a fine shroud!”
“The Satin Dress” by Dorothy Parker, Enough Rope, 1926
